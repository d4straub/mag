## Introduction

This pipeline is for assembly, binning and annotation of metagenomes.
It supports both short and long reads, quality trims the reads and adapters with [https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp](fastp) and [https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop](porechop) and performs basic QC with [https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/](fastqc).

The pipeline then:

- assigns taxonomy to reads using [https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge/](centrifuge) and/or [https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/](kraken2)
- performs assembly using [https://github.com/voutcn/megahit](megahit) and [http://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/](spades), and checks their quality using [http://quast.sourceforge.net/quast](quast)
- performs metagenome binning using [https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat/src/master/](metabat2), and checks the quality of the genome bins using [https://busco.ezlab.org/](busco)

Furthermore, the pipeline creates various reports in the results directory specified, including a [https://multiqc.info/](multiqc) report summarizing some of the findings and software versions.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.
